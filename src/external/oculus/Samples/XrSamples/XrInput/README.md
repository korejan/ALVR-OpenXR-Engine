# OpenXR Action System Sample

## Overview
The OpenXR Action System is an approach to handling input across a multitude of VR/AR devices. It allows developers to define "actions" within their applications and bind these actions to specific inputs on different devices. This device-agnostic system not only makes applications compatible with a wide range of devices without needing specific code for each one but also future-proofs applications against new devices.
