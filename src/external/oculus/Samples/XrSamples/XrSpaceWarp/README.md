# OpenXR Space Warp Sample

## Overview
`XR_FB_space_warp`: By feeding application-generated motion vector and depth buffer images, the runtime can perform high-quality frame extrapolation and reprojection. This allows applications to run at half the fps while still providing a smooth experience to users.

## The Sample
This sample shows the difference between enabling and disabling space warp. Users can pull the trigger to disable space warp and observe the difference.
