# OpenXR Body, Face, Eye Social Sample

## Overview
The extensions XR_FB_body_tracking, XR_FB_eye_tracking_social, and XR_FB_face_tracking2 are designed to work together to support querying devices for information associated with the body, allowing the rendering of a user's avatar.

XR_FB_body_tracking allows applications to get poses of body joints. XR_FB_face_tracking2 enables applications to capture facial expressions. XR_FB_eye_tracking_social provides applications with eye-tracking information for social/avatar use cases.

## The Sample
